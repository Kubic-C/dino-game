# dino-game
a copy of the dino-game from google remade in the console.
windows 10 only.

(for people generating a vs2019 project)
if you're a error that is among the lines of "unable to start programe 'some dir' the system cannot find the file specified"
then right click on dino-game project then click "set as startup project"

tried to add color but it makes the wrapping freak out or
the color itself freak out
